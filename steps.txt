back end steps:
->the user will give pdf
->extract data from pdf
->convert the data into text chunks
->then apply embedding model and get vector embeddings
->build the semantic index
->store the semantic index in vectoredDB(FAISS)


front end:
->user will give a query
->convert into query embedding
->apply semantic search on the vectoredDB
->DB will return some ranked result
->by using LLM we will extract the exact answer

How to commit in git through git bash?
->git add.
->git commit -m "comment on the change"
->git push origin main

Steps:
->make a git hub(name,public,readme,gitignore,mit)
->clone it(git clone link)
->create a template.py file(this will automatically create the folder structures)
->just mention the folder or file names and path
->type in gitbash-- python template.py
->do the setup.py
->create venv
->pip install -r requirements.txt
->paste your google api key(https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) in the .env file
->.env file is included in the gitignore file bacause we are storing the api key in 
   that file so while committing the .env file will be ignored
->we can access the .env file using python package python-dotenv
->use trial.ipynb to do all the trial coding
->fetch the api key using load_env package
APP dev starts:
->go to app.py
->write the streamlit code and save it
->go to bash and type-- streamlit run app.py
Write all the funtions related to embeddinds,database,chunking in the helper.py
->after writing all the necessary functions,implement this is the app.py
